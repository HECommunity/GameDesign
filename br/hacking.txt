This is a broad topic. To narrow it down, we'll be using "hacking" as "illegal remote access to other server". Of course illegal is OK within the game ;)

Currently, there are two main ways to get remote access to another server: 

- [[en:hacking:brute-force|Brute-force attack]]
- [[en:hacking:exploit|Exploit attack]]

In the future we'll add more attack mechanisms.
